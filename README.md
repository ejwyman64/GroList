# Welcome to GroList!
GroList is a categorized grocery shopping list. 
Never forget an item because it was randomly placed in your chaotic list.
GroList brings the peace of organization to the chore of grocery shopping, and GRO!

## Why I made this project:
I made this project to meet the class requirements for Code Louisville's C# and .NET class.
The assignment was to create something that used object oriented programming in C#, it had to 
serialize and deserialize data from some source, and the data had to be manipulated in some way
by the user, but I was able to choose the direction I took the project and what it would ultimately 
do. I decided on the categorized shopping list one afternoon while I was making my shopping list. 
I thought it would be good if there was a way to save your grocery lists and then reference them 
later. So I created GroList! I learned so much making this project, but some of my favorite 
lessons were using Enums, deserializing and serializing data, and switch statements. Thank you 
for checking out GroList!
